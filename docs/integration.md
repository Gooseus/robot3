# Integrations

Robot is easy to use on its own, however we also have a few integration points with popular libraries. The following integrations are available:

## Libraries

* __[preact-robot](./integrations/preact-robot.html)__: Provides the `useMachine` hook for use with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and `preact/hooks`.
* __[haunted-robot](./integrations/haunted-robot.html)__: Provides the `useMachine` hook for use with [Haunted](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted).
* __[robot-hooks](./integrations/robot-hooks.html)__: A generic library for creating hooks for any hook-supporting view library. This is used internally by the above libraries.
